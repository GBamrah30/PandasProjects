This is a program I created that takes a csv BudgetTracker file (provided in the folder) that is currently filled with dummy information, and provides you with useful analytics of your spending.

It is possible to add new columns, new rows of information, as well as delete them, however the four basic columns this csv file should contain for graphs of your information are date; category; amount; description
